== Egg 

Egg is a charting tool (currently with histograms only) that accepts events from your custom application and uses their frequency to chart time-based custom analytics for your app. For example, you could fire off a ping to Egg whenever someone logs into your application. Over time, Egg will collect these events and build you an hourly/weekly/monthly view of all the logins to your application.
